# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analyis is to create a presentation for potential investors to open a Citibike franchise in Des Moines, Iowa. The data collected was taken from the Citibike repository from NYC, dated August 2019. Using Pandas to manipulate the data formats, I was able to create a visual representation of different facets of the popularity of Citibikes in NYC and how it could possibly be a good model to implement in other cities across the country.

## Results:

The map below highlights the popularity of Citibikes across most of Manhattan. NYC is a hub of activity. The larger and darker circles indicate higher frequences of bicycle rentals. These locations are correlated to higher tourist traffic areas.

The most common rental times are visible by the darker shaded cells. During the weekdays, 8am and 5pm-6pm show higher rates of riders; this is perhaps connected to working start and end hours. On the weekend, the common rental hours are in the late morning and afternoon times.

From the sharp angle of this curve, you can see that the majority of rides last less than 20 minutes in duration.

According to the two graphs below, the majority of riders are men.

The three tables show the stoptime by gender (male, female, unknown). Though the shades are different intesities, the tables for females and males show a similar distribution of riders preferred stoptimes throughout the day.

Here, we can see that male subscribers clearly outnumber female subscribers, female customers, and male customers. In particular, the heaviest traffic day is on Thursdays for male subscribers.

## Summary: 
Overall, the data from NYC August 2019 shows a robust model for how Citibike functions. The visualizations presented show popular hubs in high traffic areas which have known tourist attractions. Likewise, the data also indicates that the majority of riders are male. Tripdurations tend to span less than 20 minutes overall. Most riders prefer to take bikes on weekdays around 8am at the start of the typical work day, and again betweeen 5pm and 6pm at the end of the usual work day. On the weekends, however, typical riders rent bikes in the late morning around 10am through the later afternoon hours.

Further analysis is recommended before committing to a business plan. For one, it is suggested to use more updated data as the pandemic may have shifted rider preferences and impacted business. Secondly, it would be useful to know age ranges for users. The age distribution may be drastically different in NYC versus Des Moines. It is also suggested to investigate population demographics as well as road conditions for Des Moines. If bicycle lanes are not present and there is not a biking culture, then Des Moines may not be as receptive as NYC to a Citibike experience.
